[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindTRAC_IK.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "TRAC_IK", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "TRAC_IK" with any
  of the following names:

    TRAC_IKConfig.cmake
    trac_ik-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "TRAC_IK" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "TRAC_IK_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "TRAC_IK" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
